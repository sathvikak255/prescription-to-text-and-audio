# Handwritten Doctor's Prescription to Text Conversion, Classification System and Medicine Scheduler

## Project Description:
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can convert doctor's handwritten prescriptions into machine-readable text and classify the medicines along with their doses. The system will also send an alert to the patient's registered email address containing all the relevant prescription details. The project will utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) 

1. AWS Textract - Extract text from doctor's handwritten prescriptions.

2. NER Model - Classify the extracted text into relevant categories. 

3. Alert System - Send an email alert containing all the prescription details (medicines, doses, and category) to the patient's registered email address.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
- AWS Textract 
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Cron Jobs
